# Udacity Front End Track "Portfolio Project"

This is the first project of the **Udacity Front End Track**. I used Flexbox to layout the web page and CSS Grid for the top navbar.

## Styling

All stylings is in one single file `style.css` except `responsive.css` (for responsiveness), however i made also every section's **_styling_** on the page on it's own file in order to make the `code` easy to read and easy to maintain as well.

**IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF SEPARATING EACH STYLING FILE DEPENDING ON IT'S SECTION ON THE PAGE, JUST SKIP TO THE ATTRIBUTION PART.**

## How to deal with the other CSS files

All files are in a folder called **sections_styling**

**Below shows every _section_ with it's _own styling file_:**
1. Navbar: navbar.css
2. Header: header.css
3. Main: main.css
4. About: about.css
5. Skills: skills.css
6. Portoflio: portfolio.css
7. Recent Projects: recent.css
8. Footer: footer.css

In order to use these files:
1. Go to the `html` file
2. Comment the `link` element that include the `css/style.css` path.
3. Uncomment the other CSS `link`

**NOTE:** do not comment or remove neither `normalize.css` nor `responsive.css` files unless you would like to do some modifications.
